# Mac-Terminal-Color-
To make  difference of colors between input command and output of that command on mac terminal. (In this repo, i will only be talking about the zsh shell ) 
So if your default shell is not zsh make sure you make it first before following the steps.
We can make difference of the colors using plugins like oh my zsh , iterm2 and many othersbut i am doing it on default terminal app and you don't need to download anything.
