 To have different output and  input color you have to follow the following steps : 
  
 1) First check which shell is your mac using as default by using < echo $SHELL >
    command , if it says (bin/zsh) then you are good to go .
 2) Now we need to modify zshrc file.
    You can find this file inside the etc directory of root directory i.e /etc 
    You can directly go to that etc directory by using < cd /etc > and do < ls >.
    You will see zshrc file on the bottom of the the list . 

 3) Now we need to edit that zshrc file, Use < sudo nano zshrc > or <sudo vim zshrc>
    which terminal based editor you are friendly you are . 

 4) Now at the end of the file you have to copy this code, make sure you comment
    your original PS1 variable using # in front of it as #PS1="%n@%m %1~ %#"  
 
 5) Now you will add the following code so that you will have different colors of input
    and output . 



 #For customizing 
 autoload -U colors && colors
 export PS1="%F{214}%K{000}%n%F{015}%K{000}:%F{039}%K{000}%~%F{015}%K{000}\$ "

 export CLICOLOR=1
 export LSCOLORS=gxBxhxDxfxhxhxhxhxcxcx
 alias ls='ls -Gp'

 #For Desktop 
 cd ~
 # Useful support for interacting with Terminal.app or other terminal programs
 [ -r "/etc/zshrc_$TERM_PROGRAM" ] && . "/etc/zshrc_$TERM_PROGRAM‚Äù

  

 6) Now you save this and you are good to go. 



  NOTE:Everytime you update your mac this zshrc file gets set to default , so it's better        to put the customizing portion on new file and save it .
